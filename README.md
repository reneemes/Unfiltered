# 🌱 H.O.P.E. Hacks — Unfiltered

## 🧠 About Unfiltered

Unfiltered is a youth focused mental health awareness platform designed to help the next generation better understand their emotional world.

The name **Unfiltered** represents honesty, openness, and removing the stigma around mental health. Our goal is to create a safe, supportive space where users can learn, reflect, and grow emotionally without judgment.

## 🌍 What H.O.P.E. Stands For

This project was inspired by the core values of **H.O.P.E.**:

- **H — Health** (Mental and emotional wellness)
- **O — Oppression** (Social awareness and emotional challenges)
- **P — Pollution / Planet Wellness** (Environmental impact on well-being)
- **E — Education** (Emotional intelligence and growth)

---

## 🎯 Our Mission

Mental health education is often overlooked, especially for young people navigating societal pressure, identity, and emotional development.  
**Unfiltered** bridges that gap by offering resources, reflection, and support in a welcoming digital environment.
